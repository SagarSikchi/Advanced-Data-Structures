# Splay Tree

A splay tree is a binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. Like self-balancing binary search trees, a splay tree performs basic operations such as insertion, look-up and removal in O(log n) amortized time. For many sequences of non-random operations, splay trees perform better than other search trees, even performing better than O(log n) for sufficiently non-random patterns, all without requiring advance knowledge of the pattern. The splay tree was invented by Daniel Sleator and Robert Tarjan in 1985.
