# Dynamic Hashing

- The dynamic hashing method is used to overcome the problems of static hashing like bucket overflow.
- In this method, data buckets grow or shrink as the records increases or decreases. This method is also known as Extendable hashing method.
- This method makes hashing dynamic, i.e., it allows insertion or deletion without resulting in poor performance.
